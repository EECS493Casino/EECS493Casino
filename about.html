            For our EECS 493 class we decided to implement two card games, Blackjack and Poker for our course project. Since we were feeling creative Rain Man Casino gives the original card games a twist.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We decided to add a fun feature to both games that allows the main palyer to cheat during the game. This exciting unique feature gives the player an advantage over the AI since they know which cards their opponent has as well as which cards are on the deck. And of course, this feature can be enabled and disabled in the <b>Options</b> menu.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For more information about the game visit the <b>Help</b> menu on the homepage.
