                    <p class="text-left">
                        For our class project we developed two casino card games, Poker and Blackjack. We wanted to emphasize a different feature in the two card games so we decided to change the implementation of the games by allowing the main player to cheat. Essentially, the main player can view the opponent's hand and know which cards are on the deck or will be dealt next. The game is single player to only give this cheating advantage to one person. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        We will represent multiple views of the data, that is the hand that each of the players has plus the next cards coming up on the deck. To develop this project we used HTML and JavaScript as our main platforms. 
                    </p>
                     <br/>
                    <h2 class="text-left">Features</h2>
                    <p class="text-left">   
                        The main features are game allows is playing with the cheats and the difficulty. These settings can be changed in the game options screen to turn the cheats on/off as well as set the level of difficulty for the game, easy or hard or turn the music on/off. Currently the last two features, the difficulty and music, are not implemented yet.  
                     
                    </p>
                     <br/>
                    <h2 class="text-left">Game Play</h2>
                    <p class="text-left"> 
                        The two card games function exactly the same as any other game of Poker and Blackjack with the exception of the toggle feature for the the cheats. On the game screen, the player can access a button to toggle the feature on/off. If the feature is on, hovering over a card will allow the main player to see the card. 
                    </p>
